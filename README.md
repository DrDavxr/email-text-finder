# Email Finder :email:
> Find and display a list of all the valid emails that are found given a text file.

This email finder application searches for all the valid emails given a `.txt`file (aiming to support more file extensions in the future) by using the [RFC 5322 criteria](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322). The result is a set containing all the valid emails that were found on the text file chosen by the user.
