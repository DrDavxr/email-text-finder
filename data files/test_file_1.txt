This is a text file that contains daser1998@gmail.com several email addresses davixr2.0amazon@gmail.com like the previous
ones. From this text davixrgithub@gmail.com we expect Python to extract all the addresses and save them in a simple and
easy to access set, which does not contain repeated emails daser1998@gmail.com and we need to check the end of bydavixr@gmail.com
Furthermore, it can detect multiple domain extensions like tracasytracas@hotmail.com or thebestlvper@yahoo.com .
However, we need to create a user@alumnos.uc3m.es a searcher that gets an email list independently of the domain, since
emails like user@mit.edu is not detected.
