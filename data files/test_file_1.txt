This is a text file that contains user_1@outlook.com several email addresses user2.0github_project@gmail.com like the previous
ones. From this text user@gmail.com we expect Python to extract all the addresses and save them in a simple and
easy to access set, which does not contain repeated emails user_1@gmail.com and we need to check the end of user@gmail.com
Furthermore, it can detect multiple domain extensions like corporative.email@corporation.com or email_finder@domain.com .
However, we need to create a user@edu.domain.es a searcher that gets an email list independently of the domain, since
emails like user@mit.edu is not detected.
